** Emacs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: emacs
   :END:

I have two =Emacs= "frameworks" configs:
1. The one that I'm building myself
2. My work config that uses =Doom Emacs=

My config you can find here -> [[https://github.com/Mdsp9070/my_emacs]]

For the =Doom= config you can go here -> [[https://github.com/Mdsp9070/dotfiles/tree/main/nixos/home/doom.d][Doom config]]

** Install
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: install
   :END:

*** NixOS
The default way to install is to use =NixOS=! You can learn more [[https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/][here]].

After you boot on your machine you can install git as:
#+begin_src shell
nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA git
#+end_src

With =git= installed you can clone this repo and use my configs!
DISCLAIMER: remember to generate your own =hardware-configuration.nix= following =NixOS= manual and
replace this file from my repo!

**** Possible configs

I have 2 possible system wide configs:
1. My personal and playground config, with =Xmonad= as WE
2. My workstation config, with =Gnome3= as DE

After you had cloned this repo you can edit =services.nix= file and prepend:
#+begin_src nix
{
  imports = [ ./xmonad ]; # or ./gnome
  ...
}
#+end_src

Also, take a look into =system/network.nix= to set up correct interfaces name!

*** Use dotfiles scripts
If you don't want to use =NixOS= or =Nix= at all, you can download my =dotfiles= script!

Once you have it on hands you can provide a =DOTS_DIR= env var that points to your own
dotfiles. This script will help you to link all your files/folders to the correct place!
